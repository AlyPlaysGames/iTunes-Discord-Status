# THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FUNTIONAL WITHOUT FOLLOWING THIS GUIDE
An app to show your currently playing track on iTunes for **Windows** as your status for discord
- Only funtional on Windows

# Making the program function
- Make sure Python is installed (obviously)
- Install PyPresence by using the command "py -m pip install pypresence" in CMD
- Create an application called "iTunes" on the Discord Developer Portal and note down your Client ID from the OAuth2 section of your application
- Install Snip (from here: https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip/releases/tag/v7.0.5) and set it up for iTunes. Note down the file location of Snip.txt
- Edit "iTunes Discord Intergration.pyw" (from this repo) and replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID with the Client ID from earlier and replace SNIP.TXT_LOCATION with the location of your Snip.txt file from earlier.
- Run the program with your discord client open and it should be working!
